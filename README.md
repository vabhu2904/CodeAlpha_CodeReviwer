# CodeReviewer

CodeReviewer is a Java application that checks code files for security vulnerabilities and provides recommendations to tackle security issues using static analysis tools. This application supports Java, Python, C, C++, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Java**: Uses SpotBugs for static code analysis.
- **Python**: Uses Bandit for static code analysis.
- **C/C++**: Uses Cppcheck for static code analysis.
- **JavaScript**: Uses ESLint for static code analysis.
- Provides specific recommendations based on identified vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following tools installed on your Kali Linux system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- SpotBugs
- Bandit
- Cppcheck
- Node.js and npm (for ESLint)
- ESLint

## Installation

### 1. Install JDK

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk

Install SpotBugs
sudo apt install spotbugs

 Install Bandit
sudo apt install bandit

 Install Cppcheck
sudo apt install cppcheck

Install Node.js, npm, and ESLint
sudo apt install nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g eslint

Recommendations
Based on the static analysis, the application provides specific recommendations to address identified security vulnerabilities, such as:

Using parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.
Sanitizing user inputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent Command Injection.
Validating file paths and restricting file access to prevent Path Traversal.
Implementing CSRF protection to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
Using safe functions and performing bounds checking to prevent Buffer Overflow.
Using TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit and avoiding insecure protocols.
Using strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
Validating URLs and using safe methods to handle redirects and forwards.
Ensuring secure configuration for servers, databases, and application frameworks.
Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, and using secure storage mechanisms.
Implementing proper authentication and authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access.
